    Dear FIRSTNAME,

    April is always a moving month in the city of Boston when thousands of runners
    arrive from around the world to tackle the taxing miles of pavement and hills of
    our beloved Boston Marathon. April 16, 2018 will also mark five years since the
    bombings occurred that devastated our city when hundreds of people were
    seriously injured near the finish line, and three spectators lost their lives,
    including UMass Boston alumna Krystle Campbell.

    I am proud and overjoyed to run 2018 Boston Marathon in memory of Krystle Campbell
    as part of the University of Massachusetts’s Run for Krystle Marathon Team.

    My marathon journey will be much longer than the 26.2 miles from Hopkinton to
    Boston. As part of the Run for Krystle team, I am committed to raising money for
    the Krystle Campbell Scholarship Fund at the University of Massachusetts. Each
    year, two students who demonstrate a need for financial assistance are awarded
    scholarships. The students selected stand out among their peers for their
    exceptional grades, volunteer work, involvement in the university and community,
    and all around excellence in academics. More than 80 students applied for the
    scholarship in 2017 and many stated that without financial aid, they would not
    be able to complete their degree.

    A past recipient stated: “I am completely financially independent. Paying for
    school, rent, and living expenses has required extreme budgeting, scholarship
    searching, and several jobs to make ends meet. It has been the hardest challenge
    of my life. This scholarship will provide me with the financial security to
    prosper in my final year of school. I cannot express in words how much this
    means to me, and how much it will help me.”

    I look forward to not only reaching my goal of crossing the finish line, but
    also exceeding my goal of raising $5240 ( $200 for every mile) for the Krystle
    Campbell Scholarship Fund. Together, with my teammates, we have set a goal of
    raising $65,000 towards the fund’s ultimate investment goal of $1 million, which
    currently stands at approximately $700,000.

    I hope I can count on your support to help me exceed my goal. Your generous
    donation will honor Krystle’s life and legacy and provide inspiration to our
    team, while the funds raised will work in perpetuity to support students who
    seek to better themselves and their communities through a University of
    Massachusetts degree.

    I also try to post about my runs at my fb page https://www.facebook.com/ac.trackme


    Thank you for your support!

    Sincerely,
    Ananta
